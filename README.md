# AdventureWorks2019-Analysis

During week 8 of my Data Analyst bootcamp at Generation, in groups of 4, we were tasked with completing a report on the database structure (ER diagrams and Schemas) and analysing the data to provide insights to six specific questions. This repository contains the code I developed to address three of those questions:

4. **What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?**
   -  Sales People (SP) are more likely to less sick leave compared to other employees (EM)
6. **What is the relationship between store trading duration and Sales?**
   - No relationship between store trading duration and Sales
8. **What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?**
   - Strong positive relationship betweeen size of stores and employees - larger stores need more employees to run efficiently
   - No relationship between size of store or number of employees and revenue
   - Further analysis on additional predictors if AdventureWorks aims to increase revenue
