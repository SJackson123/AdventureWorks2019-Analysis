# AdventureWorks2019-Analysis

During week 8 of my Data Analyst bootcamp at Generation, in groups of 4, we were tasked with completing a report on the database structure (ER diagrams and Schemas) and analysing the data to provide insights to six specific questions. This repository contains the code I developed to address three of those questions:

4. **What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?**
   a. 
6. **What is the relationship between store trading duration and Sales?**
   a. No relationship between store trading duration and Sales
8. **What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?**
   a. Strong positive relationship betweeen size of stores and employees - larger stores need more employees to run efficiently
   b. No relationship between size of store or number of employees and revenue
   c. Further analysis on additional predictors if AdventureWorks aims to increase revenue
