# AdventureWorks2019-Analysis

During week 8 of my Data Analyst bootcamp at Generation, in groups of 4, we were tasked with completing a report on the database structure (ER diagrams and Schemas) and analysing the data to provide insights to six specific questions. This repository contains the code I developed to address three of those questions:

4. **What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?**
5. **What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?**
6. **What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?**
